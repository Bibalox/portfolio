          'On the UI side, a complete kit of components has been created. Thanks to this work, Bee Buzziness now has a product offering that is more coherent and, above all, more in tune with our usersâ€™ needs. The development teams have not been left out either, thanks to a more rigorous and less dispersed framework. Every day, the result is cleaner code thatâ€™s quicker to produce.'

My aim was to create a simple navigation system that would stand out from competing solutions. A set of around a hundred icons was also designed, representing the various consoles, controllers and storage media.',
