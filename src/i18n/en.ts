Thanks to this work, Bee Buzziness now has a product offering that is more coherent and, above all, more in tune with our usersâ€™ needs.

My aim was to create a simple navigation system that would stand out from competing solutions. A set of around a hundred icons was also designed, representing the various consoles, controllers and storage media.',
